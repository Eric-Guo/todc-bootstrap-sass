# Bootstrap::Google::Sass

This is the `sass` edition of the [google-bootstrap](http://todc.github.com/google-bootstrap) project.  

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

    gem 'bootstrap-sass-google'

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install bootstrap-sass-google

## Usage

For now, just support `rails 3+`  
It more like a patch!! so it must work with another `bootstrap` gem such as [bootstrap-sass](https://github.com/thomas-mcdonald/bootstrap-sass)  
just like it:

```scss

@import "bootstrap";
@import "bootstrap-google":

```

and then, enjoy it.
